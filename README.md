Project Title: Car Price Prediction and Analysis

Authors: Ekta Halani and Nachiketh Mamidi

Project Description (5 Sentences):
In this project, we plan on analyzing data about cars from a car auction site and using our analysis to predict the prices of the cars.
The brand, mileage, transmission, and engine would all impact the price of the car. So, analyzing these features of the car data would
be an important part of our project. We will use web scraping to obtain the data and tools such as pandas and numpy to organize the data.
Cleaning the data would also need to be done before we organize it.

Project Title: Car Price Prediction and Analysis

Authors: Ekta Halani and Nachiketh Mamidi

Project Description (5 Sentences):
In this project, we plan on analyzing data about cars from a car auction site and using our analysis to predict the prices of the cars.
The brand, mileage, transmission, and engine would all impact the price of the car. So, analyzing these features of the car data would
be an important part of our project. We will use web scraping to obtain the data and tools such as pandas and numpy to organize the data.
Cleaning the data would also need to be done before we organize it.

Project Outline/Plan:
-  Interface Plan:
   We will create a web interface using Flask and plan on having at least two interface windows: one will be the homepage and the other one would be a pop up window that shows up when the user interacts with the homepage. To      interact with the homepage, we will create some buttons to compare by price, mileage, brand etc. There will also be other buttons so that users can edit their preferences and interact with the data

- Data Collection and Storage Plan (written by Author #1):
  We plan on scraping the data using BeautifulSoup and requests modules. We plan on getting the data from 3 different car auction websites. We will organize the scraped data from this site into a txt or csv file.
